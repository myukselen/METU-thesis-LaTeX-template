% Abstract in English

\abstract{The need to analyze and closely study the gene related mechanisms motivated the research
	on the modeling and control of gene regulatory networks (GRN). Different approaches exist to
	model GRNs; they are mostly simulated as mathematical models that represent relationships
	between genes. Though it turns into a more challenging problem, we argue that partial
	observability would be a more natural and realistic method for handling the control of GRNs.
	Partial observability is a fundamental aspect of the problem; it is mostly ignored and
	substituted by the assumption that states of GRN are known precisely, prescribed as full
	observability. On the other hand, current works addressing partially observability focus on
	formulating algorithms for the finite horizon GRN control problem. So, in this work we
	explore the feasibility of realizing the problem in a partially observable setting, mainly
	with Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP). We proposed a POMDP formulation
	for the infinite horizon version of the problem. Knowing the fact that POMDP problems suffer
	from the curse of dimensionality, we also proposed a POMDP solution method that
	automatically decomposes the problem by isolating different unrelated parts of the problem,
	and then solves the reduced subproblems. We also proposed a method to enrich  gene
	expression data sets given as input to POMDP control task, because in available data sets
	there are thousands of genes but only tens or rarely hundreds of samples. The method is
	based on the idea of generating more than one model using the available data sets, and then
	sampling data from each of the models and finally filtering the generated samples with the
	help of metrics that measure compatibility, diversity and coverage of the newly generated
samples.}

\oz{Genlerin çalışma prensiplerini inceleme gereksinimi gen düzenleyici ağların (GDA) modellenmesi
	ve kontrolü üzerine bilimsel çalışmalar yapılmasına yol açmıştır. GDA'ları modellemek için
	değişik yaklaşımlar mevcuttur ve bu yaklaşımların çoğu genler arasındaki ilişkileri
	matematiksel modeller vasıtasıyla modellemektedir.  Problemi daha zorlaştırmasına rağmen,
	GDA kontrol problemlerinin daha doğal ve gerçekçi çözülebilmesi için kısmi
	gözlemlenebilirliğin önerilmesi gerektiğini savunuyoruz.  Kısmi gözlemlenebilirlik bu
	problemin temel bir bileşeni olmasına rağmen çoğunlukla gözardı edilmiş ve problemin
	çözümünde GDA'nın tüm durumlarının mükemmel olarak bilinebileceği varsayımı yapılmıştır,
	yani problem tam gözlemlenebilir kabul edilmiştir. Bir yandan da literatürdeki kısmi
	gözlemlenebilirliği dikkate alan yöntemler sınırlı adımdan oluşan bir problem tanımı ile GDA
	kontrol problemini çözen algoritmalar üretmeye çalışmaktadır. Bu çalışmada problemin kısmi
	gözlemlenebilir bir kurgu ile tanımlanması üzerinde çalışılmakta ve Kısmi Gözlemlenebilir
	Markov Karar Süreçleri (POMDP) bu kurguda kullanılmaktadır. Bu çalışmada problemin sonsuz
	adımdan oluşan bir hali problem POMDP modeline uygun bir şekilde tanımlanarak sunulmaktadır.
	POMDP problemlerinin boyutlardan kaynaklanan problemler yaşamasından dolayı POMDP
	problemlerin birbirinden bağımsız parçalarını ayırıp problemi otomatik olarak parçalayan ve
	bu parçaları çözerek problemin çözümünü bulan bir çözüm yaklaşımı da bu çalışmada
	sunulmuştur. Bu çalışmada ayrıca POMDP kontrol problemine girdi olarak verilen gen ifade
	verisini zenginleştirmek için de bir metot sunulmaktadır. Gen ifade verilerinde binlerce gen
	olmasına rağmen genelde onlarca, nadir olarak da yüz mertebesinde örneklem bulunduğundan
	böyle bir metot gerekli ve faydalıdır. Sunulan metot varolan veri kümesini kullanarak birden
	fazla model oluşturur; her modelden yeni veri noktaları üretikten sonra üretilen veri
	noktalarını veri kümesinin uygunluğunu, farklılığını ve genişliğini ölçen metrikler
yardımıyla filtreyerek kullanıma hazır bir veri kümesi oluşturur.}

\acknowledgments{I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Faruk Polat for his constant support,
	guidance and friendship. It was a great honor to work with him for the last twelve years and
	our cooperation influenced my academical and world view highly.  I also would like to thank
	Professor Reda Alhajj for his support and guidance on my stay at Calgary. While away from my
	home, he not only supported me on my research but also provided that I feel welcome and
	personally attended all my needs and problems. He also motivated and influenced me highly in
	scientific context.

A lot of people influenced and supported this work scientifically and their contribution were most
valuable for me. Assist. Prof. Mehmet Tan personally supplied a lot of important material for the
real kick off of this work. His ideas and support made it possible that in a short time I were able
to build the frame of this work. Members of my thesis committee Professor Varol Akman and Assoc.
Prof. Halit Oğuztüzün always gave valuable feedback for the progress of this work, and were not
hesitant to warn me of the shortcomings or risks of my work. Assoc. Prof. Tolga Can also provided
valuable feedback for the future of this research, which I very appreciate. I would also like to
thank Assoc. Prof. Douglas J. Demetrick of UofC, our talks about my research not only inspired me
but also helped me to understand the biological aspects of the work.

This work is also supported by TÜBİTAK-BİDEB PhD scholarship (2211) and TÜBİTAK-ARDEB Scientific and
Technological Research Project Program (1001) (Project No: \#110E179).

In METU-CENG a lot of colleagues provided feedback or inspiration on this work, some of them were
Ahmet Saçan, Sertan Girgin, and Utku Şirin. I also would like to thank Göktürk Üçoluk, Meltem Turhan
Yöndem, Cevat Şener, Onur Tolga Şehitoğlu, Hakkı Toroslu for their friendship and making me feel
like home at METU-CENG. I also like to thank Professor Müslim Bozyiğit and Professor Adnan Yazıcı
who provided me comfortable working environment after my research assistantship period. 

I was also lucky to find another home in Calgary, Canada. I'd like to thank Mohammed Alshalalfa, Gao
Shang, Ian Reinhart and Faraz Rasheed for their contributions and feedbacks on my research. I also
like to thank Keivan Kianmehr for making me feel welcome there. I would also like to thank Alhajj
family, who gave me a warm welcome in Calgary. 

My family also provided invaluable support for this work. I would like to thank specially to my
uncle Zeki Erdoğdu. He always make me feel loved and cared. I am also thankful for all the love and
support by Sevilay Erdoğdu, Emin-Esra-Dicle-Deniz Erdoğdu, Hülya Oruç, Asiye Erdoğdu, Ahmet Erdoğdu,
Sebahat-Serhun-Dilhun Ayaydın, Özlem-Metin-İpek Sarıbaş, Aynur-Kenan-Cihan-Berna Baykan.  My father
Abdulkadir Erdoğdu was not able to see this work completed, however his memory was with me all the
way to the end.

And there are a lot of people that were with me in these eight years. They defined me, they made me
who I am, they are true owners of this work. It is not possible to write down why each of them is
important to me and this work, because it will take more space than the work itself. So I'll just
give names of some of them; Neslihan Arslan, Selma Süloğlu, Hande Çelikkanat, Ömer Nebil Yaveroğlu,
Gökdeniz Karadağ, Sinan Kalkan, Burçin Sapaz, Turan Yüksel, Aykut Erdem, Erkut Erdem, Ruken Çakıcı,
Oğuz Özün, Semra Doğandağ, Burcu Büyükkağnıcı, Ayça Aksu, Mehmet Ersan Topaloğlu, Servet Kızıltaş,
Emre Hamit Kök, Sedar Gökbulut, Özgür Kaya, Gültekin Kurtar, Serdar Özcan, Fatih Balkan and İsmet
Yalabık.

And finally very special thanks to a group of people who've taught me real meaning of friendship
lately. Special thanks to the residents of the most joyful office ever, A-206~: Kerem Hadımlı, Can
Hoşgör, Okan Akalın, Merve Aydınlılar and Elvan Gülen.}
